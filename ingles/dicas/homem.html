<h1><center>DICAS GERAIS</center></h1>
<div>
<h3><center>HOMENS</center></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Say no to "white foods": </b> Avoid foods made with white flour: refined grains, white sugar, soda, snacks and other processed foods. These foods are devoid of natural fibers and their vitamins and minerals. Instead, eat high-fiber vegetables such as fruits, whole grains, and legumes.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Avoid trans fat: </b>do not just cut down on the consumption of fatty foods. You need to keep a close watch on the types of fat you eat. Avoid saturated fats, fried foods and anything made with hydrogenated oils (margarines, bought cakes, cookies) because they contain trans fats that increase the risk of heart disease. Instead consume only healthy fat such as omega-3 oils and olive oil as these protect against heart disease.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do not skip breakfast: </b>Try to have your breakfast as soon as possible, after waking up in the morning. Eating early makes your metabolism speed up throughout the day. Include fiber and protein in your breakfast.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Have a colorful diet: </b>Rich and bright colorful fruits and vegetables contain flavonoids and carotenoids, powerful compounds that eliminate free radicals from your body, reducing inflammation. Red tomatoes contain lycopene that reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. Salads with colorful vegetables provide phytonutrients that are not available on green leaves.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Foods that naturally burn fat: </b>Include in your diet foods that naturally burn fat such as cayenne, cinnamon, green tea, ginger, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, citrus fruits (especially lemon), and apple cider vinegar . </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Be Green: </b>Swap black tea for green tea. Green tea is packed with polyphenols, which improve heart health and prevent cancer. </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Stop Smoking: </b>It is the best health and wellness tip to live longer and stay young and healthy. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for your health. It is not only a cause of lung disease but also lung cancer, COPD and colorectal cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Regular exercise: </b>It is a healthy habit that decreases the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity and osteoporosis. Exercise also benefits your mood and reduces the risk of depression.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do some activity in the sun: </b>only 15 to 20 minutes of exposure to sunlight per day (always with sunscreen) can provide the required daily amount of vitamin D. The substance helps fight diabetes, heart attacks, heart failure, pressure High blood pressure and perhaps even the common cold. But do not overdo it, too much exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Maintain ideal Weight: </b>A healthy weight not only makes you feel better, but reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and other big killers.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Hang out with healthy people: </b>other people's good habits can pass on to you. Studies suggest that a number of factors, such as apparent happiness, obesity, smoking, and even loneliness, are strongly influenced by the people around you. So be selective towards friends.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Loss of abdominal fat: </b>too much fat in the belly can raise blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart problems and decreased bone density. Your belly circumference should be less than half your height. If you are more than 1.80 m, your measurement should be at 92 cm. Getting rid of diabetes and heart problems should be a sufficient motivation for you to lose belly fat. But also think that at every point you increase in your body mass index, your age decreases in 25 years and your testosterone drops to 3%, which is not very virile.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Drinking alcohol in moderation: </b>It is best to avoid alcohol, or at least drink in moderation. Moderate consumption reduces the risk of heart and coronary artery disease. While one or two cups (standard size) work as a protection, excessive drinking is the cause for physical illness and social disaster. And for some, even a drink is too much. One point to note is that approximately 10% of people who start drinking socially become alcoholics in time. </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Regular amount of sleep: </b>sleep for about seven hours a night. This helps not only to live longer but also decreases stress, sharpens memory, improves the immune system and keeps hormones in balance. Avoid working late at night in front of the computer as this stimulates your brain and disrupts your night's sleep. If you do not have time to sleep at night, consider taking a nap during the day.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Avoid constipation: </b>Increase your intake of fiber and water.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Cholesterol and high blood pressure: </b>holesterol and high blood pressure function as silent killers. They quietly damage your heart and arteries without showing any symptoms, until it is often too late. Men have a higher risk of heart attacks than women.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Blood Sugar: </b>Pre-diabetes is a condition in which sugar is high but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. But this is just as damaging as the diabetes itself. Always stay informed about your sugar level and start caring for yourself. Exercise and have a complex carbohydrate diet to keep blood sugar in a safe area. </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Love your prostate: </b>this is a men's disease. Take regular physicals and take good care of your prostate.</li>
<br/>
<h3><center>The following are the top ten supplements for prostate health:</center></h3>
<ol>
<li>Herbal remedies are considered as some of the best prostate health supplements.</li>
<br/>
<li>Nettle root is an effective natural supplement for prostate health. It reduces urinary flow obstruction by improving the urinary symptoms associated with the enlarged prostate.</li>
<br/>
<li>The red clover contains an antioxidant that fights cancerous growth. Red clover inhibits the formation of DHT (dihydrotestosterone).</li>
<br/>
<li>The doses of vitamin C and vitamin B6 are also some of the best supplements for prostate health. They facilitate urination and prevent swelling.</li>
<br/>
<li>Another supplement for an enlarged prostate is soy (miso, soy milk) and fish oil. Selenium, found in Brazil nuts, slows the progression of tumor growth.</li>
<br/>
<li>Lycopene contains powerful antioxidants. Lycopene is found in red tomato and other tomato-based products (such as ketchup and puree), is a natural supplement for prostate health. </li>
<br/>
<li>Fruits like guava, watermelon and pink grapefruit are natural supplements for prostate health. Fructose (the sugar found in fruits) stimulates the production of vitamin D that inhibits tumors.</li>
<br/>
<li>Garlic, saffron, ginger and rosemary act as supplements for the enlarged prostate. Health supplements for the prostate include skullcap, basil and oregano.</li>
<br/>
<li>Green tea (EGCG) prevents prostate cancer by acting as a natural inhibitor of an enlarged prostate.</li>
<br/>
<li>Copper zinc supplements are also recommended for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.</li>
