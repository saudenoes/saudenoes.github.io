<h1><center>GENERAL TIPS</center><h1>

<h3><center>WOMEN</center></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Taking a Cholesterol Test:</b> Most women care very much about breast cancer, but in fact, heart disease is the number one killer of women. Take a cholesterol test to see if you are at risk.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Maintain Positive Attitude:</b> Studies have proven that people who maintain positive attitudes produce more antibodies against the flu. Another study showed that people living in the radiant state make more antibodies in response to vaccination. Researchers are unclear about the connection, but they know the brain communicates with the immune system and vice versa.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Ingesting Calcium:</b> Many people do not consume enough calcium, which helps prevent osteoporosis, through diet. Women between the ages of 19 and 50 should ingest 1000 milligrams or eat 3 to 4 servings of food rich in mineral (taken with vitamin D for absorption) per day.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Physical exercises to improve mood:</b> Physical activities bring a number of health benefits and can reduce the risk of heart disease, arthritis and others. But the best news is that it can improve mood. One study found that for depressed people, exercise was as effective as antidepressant medication.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Relationship:</b> Having a good network of friends and family is associated with greater longevity, while loneliness is associated with risks of heart disease.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Check your sex life:</b> it 's good to check your sex life. Make sure your sexual habits are out of control, destroying your relationships, as well as disrupting your life in general. That could be a problem.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Get a massage:</b> Massage can be a secret weapon. Even when performing stressful activities, those who receive a monthly massage better support the effects of the grueling routine.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Toast:</b> Drinking moderately, no more than one drink a day for women, can protect you from cardiovascular disease. And it can help prevent excessive weight gain, according to research. Just do not overdo it.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do some activity in the sun:</b> only 15 to 20 minutes of exposure to sunlight per day (always with sunscreen) can provide the required daily amount of vitamin D. The substance helps fight diabetes, heart attacks, heart failure, pressure High blood pressure and perhaps even the common cold. But do not overdo it, too much exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Consult your dentist:</b> Oral health is more than just keeping your teeth beautiful. In particular, periodontal disease is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Then visit your dentist.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Hang out with healthy people:</b> other people's good habits can pass on to you. Studies suggest that a number of factors, such as apparent happiness, obesity, smoking, and even loneliness, are strongly influenced by the people around you. So be selective towards friends.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Write a list:</b> Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to your health. There are ten tests you can do this year, including a skin checkup, blood test and hearing screening, which can help you understand your overall health and avoid future problems.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Test the amount of blood sugar:</b> Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is high but not too high enough to be classified as diabetes. But it is almost as toxic to the body as diabetes itself. What's more, about 57 million people in the US have pre-diabetes, but they do not know that. Regular exercise and a high fiber content in the diet, coupled with the consumption of healthy carbohydrates, can keep blood sugar within the range of safety</li>
<br/>
<li><b>To take a cold shower:</b> Devotees say that cold showers help in low energy consumption, avoid migraines, help in good circulation and reduce pain, and allow women to age gracefully. (Some even argue that they are the secret of the French woman to have firm breasts.)</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Exercise your bones:</b> Exercising like walking, dancing or weight lifting can keep your bones strong and healthy. Experts recommend at least two and a half hours per week.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Control Your Stress:</b> Stress is not only unpleasant but can also harm health by increasing inflammation in the body and risks of heart disease.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Mammography:</b> Some doctors say that the best age for getting a mammogram is at 40, others say the ideal age is at 50. Find out what your doctor thinks is right for you, based on your age and other risk factors.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Consume a little ginger:</b> For centuries, ginger has been used in the treatment of a range of stomach problems. Researchers believe that their compounds stimulate digestive secretions and improve intestinal muscle tone.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat banana:</b> or another food rich in potassium and low in sodium, such as a potato cooked with skin or an avocado. This type of food, in addition to helping with weight loss and exercise, can keep blood pressure under control.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Make sleep a priority:</b> Sleep may be the last on your list, but maybe it's time to move it up. New research suggests that lack of sleep can disrupt blood sugar control and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Wash hands:</b> habit is the number attitude in preventing diseases such as colds, in addition to keeping away other problems such as infections by bacteria and other viruses.</li>
<br/>

<br/>
<li><b>Choose healthy foods:</b> they are tasty items that offer you more antioxidants, healthy fats or other good ingredients in relation to the amount of calories consumed.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Living With Purpose:</b> Research shows that people who are happy and have a purpose in life are less likely to develop cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Why not start young?</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Pay attention to joint pains:</b> there is no age to develop joint problems, such as in the knees. Excess weight and little physical drive work together.</li>
<br/>

It helps increase defenses against diseases and is likely to help prevent cancer and improve heart health.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Stop with certain habits:</b> find a method that works best for you to quit smoking addiction forever.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat a little chocolate:</b> eating a quarter of chocolate every day, an amount equal to about a small Easter egg, can reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat beans and fruits:</b> red beans tops the list of foods with the highest concentration of antioxidants, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Fruits also come in the list of items with the same benefit.</li>
<br/>
