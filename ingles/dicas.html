<h1><center>GENERAL TIPS</center></h1>
<h3><center>MAN</center></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Say no to "white foods": </b> Avoid foods made with white flour: refined grains, white sugar, soda, snacks and other processed foods. These foods are devoid of natural fibers and their vitamins and minerals. Instead, eat high-fiber vegetables such as fruits, whole grains, and legumes.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Avoid trans fat: </b>do not just cut down on the consumption of fatty foods. You need to keep a close watch on the types of fat you eat. Avoid saturated fats, fried foods and anything made with hydrogenated oils (margarines, bought cakes, cookies) because they contain trans fats that increase the risk of heart disease. Instead consume only healthy fat such as omega-3 oils and olive oil as these protect against heart disease.</li>
<img class="img-responsive left" src="http://icon-icons.com/icons2/236/PNG/256/Breakfast_26375.png">
<br/>
<li><b>Do not skip breakfast: </b>Try to have your breakfast as soon as possible, after waking up in the morning. Eating early makes your metabolism speed up throughout the day. Include fiber and protein in your breakfast.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Have a colorful diet: </b>Rich and bright colorful fruits and vegetables contain flavonoids and carotenoids, powerful compounds that eliminate free radicals from your body, reducing inflammation. Red tomatoes contain lycopene that reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. Salads with colorful vegetables provide phytonutrients that are not available on green leaves.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Foods that naturally burn fat: </b>Include in your diet foods that naturally burn fat such as cayenne, cinnamon, green tea, ginger, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, citrus fruits (especially lemon), and apple cider vinegar . </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Be Green: </b>Swap black tea for green tea. Green tea is packed with polyphenols, which improve heart health and prevent cancer. </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Stop Smoking: </b>It is the best health and wellness tip to live longer and stay young and healthy. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for your health. It is not only a cause of lung disease but also lung cancer, COPD and colorectal cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Regular exercise: </b>It is a healthy habit that decreases the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity and osteoporosis. Exercise also benefits your mood and reduces the risk of depression.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do some activity in the sun: </b>only 15 to 20 minutes of exposure to sunlight per day (always with sunscreen) can provide the required daily amount of vitamin D. The substance helps fight diabetes, heart attacks, heart failure, pressure High blood pressure and perhaps even the common cold. But do not overdo it, too much exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Maintain ideal Weight: </b>A healthy weight not only makes you feel better, but reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and other big killers.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Hang out with healthy people: </b>other people's good habits can pass on to you. Studies suggest that a number of factors, such as apparent happiness, obesity, smoking, and even loneliness, are strongly influenced by the people around you. So be selective towards friends.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Loss of abdominal fat: </b>too much fat in the belly can raise blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart problems and decreased bone density. Your belly circumference should be less than half your height. If you are more than 1.80 m, your measurement should be at 92 cm. Getting rid of diabetes and heart problems should be a sufficient motivation for you to lose belly fat. But also think that at every point you increase in your body mass index, your age decreases in 25 years and your testosterone drops to 3%, which is not very virile.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Drinking alcohol in moderation: </b>It is best to avoid alcohol, or at least drink in moderation. Moderate consumption reduces the risk of heart and coronary artery disease. While one or two cups (standard size) work as a protection, excessive drinking is the cause for physical illness and social disaster. And for some, even a drink is too much. One point to note is that approximately 10% of people who start drinking socially become alcoholics in time. </li>
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive right" src="https://www.saudemelhor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mitos-dormir-e1391741904912.jpg">
<li><b>Regular amount of sleep: </b>sleep for about seven hours a night. This helps not only to live longer but also decreases stress, sharpens memory, improves the immune system and keeps hormones in balance. Avoid working late at night in front of the computer as this stimulates your brain and disrupts your night's sleep. If you do not have time to sleep at night, consider taking a nap during the day.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Avoid constipation: </b>Increase your intake of fiber and water.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Cholesterol and high blood pressure: </b>holesterol and high blood pressure function as silent killers. They quietly damage your heart and arteries without showing any symptoms, until it is often too late. Men have a higher risk of heart attacks than women.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Blood Sugar: </b>Pre-diabetes is a condition in which sugar is high but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. But this is just as damaging as the diabetes itself. Always stay informed about your sugar level and start caring for yourself. Exercise and have a complex carbohydrate diet to keep blood sugar in a safe area. </li>
<br/>
<li><b>Love your prostate: </b>this is a men's disease. Take regular physicals and take good care of your prostate.</li>
<br/>
<h3><center>The following are the top ten supplements for prostate health:</center></h3>
<ol>
<li>Herbal remedies are considered as some of the best prostate health supplements.</li>
<br/>
<li>Nettle root is an effective natural supplement for prostate health. It reduces urinary flow obstruction by improving the urinary symptoms associated with the enlarged prostate.</li>
<br/>
<li>The red clover contains an antioxidant that fights cancerous growth. Red clover inhibits the formation of DHT (dihydrotestosterone).</li>
<br/>
<li>The doses of vitamin C and vitamin B6 are also some of the best supplements for prostate health. They facilitate urination and prevent swelling.</li>
<br/>
<li>Another supplement for an enlarged prostate is soy (miso, soy milk) and fish oil. Selenium, found in Brazil nuts, slows the progression of tumor growth.</li>
<br/>
<li>Lycopene contains powerful antioxidants. Lycopene is found in red tomato and other tomato-based products (such as ketchup and puree), is a natural supplement for prostate health. </li>
<br/>
<li>Fruits like guava, watermelon and pink grapefruit are natural supplements for prostate health. Fructose (the sugar found in fruits) stimulates the production of vitamin D that inhibits tumors.</li>
<br/>
<li>Garlic, saffron, ginger and rosemary act as supplements for the enlarged prostate. Health supplements for the prostate include skullcap, basil and oregano.</li>
<br/>
<li>Green tea (EGCG) prevents prostate cancer by acting as a natural inhibitor of an enlarged prostate.</li>
<br/>
<li>Copper zinc supplements are also recommended for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.</li>

</br>
</br>
<h2><center><b>WOMEN</b></center></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Taking a Cholesterol Test:</b> Most women care very much about breast cancer, but in fact, heart disease is the number one killer of women. Take a cholesterol test to see if you are at risk.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Maintain Positive Attitude:</b> Studies have proven that people who maintain positive attitudes produce more antibodies against the flu. Another study showed that people living in the radiant state make more antibodies in response to vaccination. Researchers are unclear about the connection, but they know the brain communicates with the immune system and vice versa.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Ingesting Calcium:</b> Many people do not consume enough calcium, which helps prevent osteoporosis, through diet. Women between the ages of 19 and 50 should ingest 1000 milligrams or eat 3 to 4 servings of food rich in mineral (taken with vitamin D for absorption) per day.</li>
<br/>
<img class="img-responsive right" src="http://www.gineco.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/exercicios-fisicos-2.jpg">
<li><b>Physical exercises to improve mood:</b> Physical activities bring a number of health benefits and can reduce the risk of heart disease, arthritis and others. But the best news is that it can improve mood. One study found that for depressed people, exercise was as effective as antidepressant medication.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Relationship:</b> Having a good network of friends and family is associated with greater longevity, while loneliness is associated with risks of heart disease.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Check your sex life:</b> it 's good to check your sex life. Make sure your sexual habits are out of control, destroying your relationships, as well as disrupting your life in general. That could be a problem.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Get a massage:</b> Massage can be a secret weapon. Even when performing stressful activities, those who receive a monthly massage better support the effects of the grueling routine.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Toast:</b> Drinking moderately, no more than one drink a day for women, can protect you from cardiovascular disease. And it can help prevent excessive weight gain, according to research. Just do not overdo it.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do some activity in the sun:</b> only 15 to 20 minutes of exposure to sunlight per day (always with sunscreen) can provide the required daily amount of vitamin D. The substance helps fight diabetes, heart attacks, heart failure, pressure High blood pressure and perhaps even the common cold. But do not overdo it, too much exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Consult your dentist:</b> Oral health is more than just keeping your teeth beautiful. In particular, periodontal disease is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Then visit your dentist.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Hang out with healthy people:</b> other people's good habits can pass on to you. Studies suggest that a number of factors, such as apparent happiness, obesity, smoking, and even loneliness, are strongly influenced by the people around you. So be selective towards friends.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Write a list:</b> Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to your health. There are ten tests you can do this year, including a skin checkup, blood test and hearing screening, which can help you understand your overall health and avoid future problems.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Test the amount of blood sugar:</b> Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is high but not too high enough to be classified as diabetes. But it is almost as toxic to the body as diabetes itself. What's more, about 57 million people in the US have pre-diabetes, but they do not know that. Regular exercise and a high fiber content in the diet, coupled with the consumption of healthy carbohydrates, can keep blood sugar within the range of safety</li>
<br/>
<li><b>To take a cold shower:</b> Devotees say that cold showers help in low energy consumption, avoid migraines, help in good circulation and reduce pain, and allow women to age gracefully. (Some even argue that they are the secret of the French woman to have firm breasts.)</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Exercise your bones:</b> Exercising like walking, dancing or weight lifting can keep your bones strong and healthy. Experts recommend at least two and a half hours per week.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Control Your Stress:</b> Stress is not only unpleasant but can also harm health by increasing inflammation in the body and risks of heart disease.</li>
<br/>

<li><b>Mammography:</b> Some doctors say that the best age for getting a mammogram is at 40, others say the ideal age is at 50. Find out what your doctor thinks is right for you, based on your age and other risk factors.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Consume a little ginger:</b> For centuries, ginger has been used in the treatment of a range of stomach problems. Researchers believe that their compounds stimulate digestive secretions and improve intestinal muscle tone.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat banana:</b> or another food rich in potassium and low in sodium, such as a potato cooked with skin or an avocado. This type of food, in addition to helping with weight loss and exercise, can keep blood pressure under control.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Make sleep a priority:</b> Sleep may be the last on your list, but maybe it's time to move it up. New research suggests that lack of sleep can disrupt blood sugar control and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Wash hands:</b> habit is the number attitude in preventing diseases such as colds, in addition to keeping away other problems such as infections by bacteria and other viruses.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Think About Breast Health:</b> For young women, breast cancer is often one of the last things on their minds. But you can start thinking of simple preventative measures like breastfeeding, exercises and clinical breast exams, even in your 20s and 30s.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Choose healthy foods:</b> they are tasty items that offer you more antioxidants, healthy fats or other good ingredients in relation to the amount of calories consumed.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Living With Purpose:</b> Research shows that people who are happy and have a purpose in life are less likely to develop cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Why not start young?</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Pay attention to joint pains:</b> there is no age to develop joint problems, such as in the knees. Excess weight and little physical drive work together.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat more garlic:</b> garlic is rich in antioxidants and helps fight inflammation, says Carmia Borek, PhD, professor and researcher in the department of public health and family medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, United States. It helps increase defenses against diseases and is likely to help prevent cancer and improve heart health.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Stop with certain habits:</b> find a method that works best for you to quit smoking addiction forever.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat a little chocolate:</b> eating a quarter of chocolate every day, an amount equal to about a small Easter egg, can reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Eat beans and fruits:</b> red beans tops the list of foods with the highest concentration of antioxidants, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Fruits also come in the list of items with the same benefit.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Beware of greasy foods:</b> you may get hooked. A new study (in rats) suggests that unrestricted access to high-fat foods such as bacon and cheesecake can trigger the same kind of compulsive behavior as drugs like cocaine.</li>
