<p class="title"><b>MEDICAL COUNCIL OF ES ANALYZES NEGLECT IN A TEENAGE DEATH:</b></p>
<p class="data">19/11/2014</p>
<p class="just">On the day that the adolescent who died after being excused from the Emergency Room (UPA) of Serra-Sede, Grande Vitória, was buried, the Regional Council of Medicine (CRM-ES) requested the Municipal Health Department Information on the care provided and ensured that, if negligence is found, it will file a public civil action against the city hall.</p>
<p class="just">When questioned, the Municipal Health Department of Serra argued that when it does not identify any risk, the nurses of the UPAs of Serra have autonomy to decide on the release of the patients.</p>
<p class="just">According to his mother, Carlos Henrique started complaining of chest pain on Friday (14). Around 8:30 am on Saturday (15), the general service assistant took the teenager to Upa de Serra Sede, but, according to Roseni, the son was not even examined. "I took it to Upa, I went through that classification and then the woman who answered it, who I think was a social worker, said it was not urgent. I asked her to take the exam, but she only gave me a call so I could take him to the health clinic. He just had a talk and he said, "she said, very shaken.</p>
<p class="just">Vice President of the CRM, the doctor Aloizio Faria de Souza condemned the UPA's attitude of releasing the boy without him undergoing a medical evaluation. He pointed out that, "anywhere in the world", chest pain symptom is treated as an emergency.</p>
<img class="left" src="http://s2.glbimg.com/KdIDd0HZyCWqxFWZ9U1EBVFAoHw=/300x225/s.glbimg.com/jo/g1/f/original/2014/11/16/morte_adolescente_16_11_14_1.jpeg">
<p class="just">The doctor explained that the Holy Spirit adopts the Manchester Protocol (risk classification) in the PSUs. The norm says that the nurse with higher education defines if the patient will be attended with emergency, urgency or if there is no urgency. "However, the classification of risk does not serve as a diagnosis. It just evaluates symptoms and does sorting. This child could only be released by a doctor, "he says.</p>
<p class="just">Aloisio pointed out that the death of the adolescent is an example of the "neglect" of the public power with the public health system. "Until proven otherwise, there was negligence. Every day Brazilians and Brazilians die, who should not die, for lack of adequate assistance. The responsible is the State. "
</p>
<p class="just">The Health Secretary in charge of Serra, Eida Maria Borges, said by telephone that everything will be investigated. "If the nurse dismissed it, it is because she did not identify any risk. Now we have to see why he did not identify, since the child died. At once, we can not judge. During the process we open, we will get all the information, "said Eida.</p>
<p class="just">On the day of the child's death, on Sunday (16), the two employees involved in the care of Carlos Henrique were removed from the UPA. At the time, Eida assured that the Health Department will follow up the case through an investigation.</p>
<p class="just">Ela destacou também que a secretaria vai examinar os prontuários e o laudo médico para verificar se houve falha ou não no atendimento. Também serão ouvidos os familiares do jovem. Ela garantiu que, caso seja constatada negligência, todas as providências necessárias serão tomadas. No entanto, a secretária não informou quanto tempo vai durar essa investigação.</p>
